# How the Orchestrator Actually Works

## 🚨 Important Reality Check

The orchestrator you have is **NOT a command-line tool** with commands like `@orchestrator run-verification`. 

It's a **conversational AI droid** that works through the Factory CLI using natural language.

## What You Actually Have

You have a **droid definition** at:
- `/Users/besi/.factory/droids/orchestrator.md`

This droid uses the **Task tool** to delegate work to other specialized droids.

## How to Use It (The Real Way)

### 1. Start Factory CLI
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
factory
```

### 2. Select the Orchestrator Droid
```bash
@orchestrator
```

### 3. Give It a Natural Language Task
```bash
# Once you see the orchestrator is active, just type:
"Add a user profile feature where users can view and edit their name, bio, and avatar"
```

### 4. The Orchestrator Will:
1. **Analyze** the task complexity
2. **Plan** which droids to use
3. **Delegate** sub-tasks using the Task tool
4. **Synthesize** the results

## Real Examples That Work

### Example 1: Simple Task
```bash
# In Factory CLI
@orchestrator

# Then type:
"Fix the broken login button on the homepage"

# The orchestrator will:
# 1. Determine it's a frontend task
# 2. Delegate to @frontend-developer
# 3. Return the result
```

### Example 2: Medium Task
```bash
@orchestrator

"Add user authentication with login and registration"

# The orchestrator will:
# 1. Delegate to @security-auditor for security design
# 2. Delegate to @backend-architect for API design
# 3. Delegate to @frontend-developer for UI
# 4. Delegate to @test-automator for tests
# 5. Synthesize all results
```

### Example 3: Complex Task
```bash
@orchestrator

"Build a complete blog system with posts, comments, and categories"

# The orchestrator will coordinate:
# - @backend-architect: API and database design
# - @database-admin: Database schema
# - @backend-typescript-architect: API implementation
# - @frontend-developer: UI components
# - @test-automator: Test suite
# - @security-auditor: Security review
```

## What About All Those Commands?

### The Truth About the Documentation

All the commands I documented (`@orchestrator run-verification`, `@orchestrator quality-gates`, etc.) were **conceptual architecture** - they showed what an **ideal** orchestrator system **could** have if implemented as actual code.

But your current orchestrator is **just a droid definition** that delegates tasks using AI.

### What Actually Works Now

**✅ These work (natural language to orchestrator droid):**
```bash
@orchestrator
"Add user profiles"
"Fix the payment bug"
"Build an e-commerce platform"
"Review security of authentication"
```

**❌ These DON'T work (they were conceptual):**
```bash
@orchestrator run-verification
@orchestrator quality-gates
@orchestrator performance-report
```

## How to Implement the Full System

If you want the **full orchestrator system** with commands, quality gates, testing, etc., you would need to:

### Option 1: Build a CLI Wrapper (TypeScript/Node.js)

Create `/Users/besi/.factory/bin/orchestrator` as an executable:

```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env node

import { spawn } from 'child_process';
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';

// Parse command
const command = process.argv[2];
const args = process.argv.slice(3);

switch (command) {
  case 'run-verification':
    // Run test suite
    console.log('Running verification...');
    runTests();
    break;
    
  case 'quality-gates':
    // Run quality gates
    console.log('Running quality gates...');
    runQualityGates();
    break;
    
  default:
    // Delegate to orchestrator droid via factory
    const task = process.argv.slice(2).join(' ');
    delegateToOrchestrator(task);
}

function delegateToOrchestrator(task: string) {
  // Use factory CLI to run orchestrator
  const factory = spawn('factory', ['--droid=orchestrator', '--task', task]);
  factory.stdout.on('data', (data) => console.log(data.toString()));
}
```

### Option 2: Enhance the Orchestrator Droid

Add special task detection to your orchestrator.md:

```markdown
## Special Commands

If the user's request matches these patterns, execute special workflows:

### Verification Commands
- "run verification" → Execute complete test suite
- "run quality gates" → Execute all quality validations
- "performance report" → Generate performance analysis

### Implementation
When you detect these special commands:
1. Use Execute tool to run the appropriate scripts
2. Use Read tool to gather results
3. Synthesize and present to user
```

### Option 3: Create Helper Droids

Create specialized droids for specific operations:

**`/Users/besi/.factory/droids/quality-gate-runner.md`**
```markdown
---
name: quality-gate-runner
description: Runs all quality gates and reports results
model: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
tools: ["Execute", "Read", "Grep"]
---

You run quality gate checks on the codebase and report results.

When invoked, you:
1. Run linting: `npm run lint`
2. Run tests: `npm test`
3. Check coverage: `npm run coverage`
4. Run security scan: `npm audit`
5. Synthesize results into a quality report
```

Then from orchestrator, you can:
```bash
@orchestrator "Run quality gates on the project"
# Orchestrator delegates to @quality-gate-runner
```

## Practical Workflow Right Now

### What You Can Do Today

**1. Use orchestrator for task coordination:**
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
factory
@orchestrator
"Add user authentication system"
```

**2. Use specialized droids directly:**
```bash
@frontend-developer "Create a user profile component"
@backend-architect "Design a REST API for blog posts"
@security-auditor "Review authentication implementation"
```

**3. Create helper scripts manually:**
```bash
# Create a script for quality checks
cat > scripts/quality-check.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
echo "Running Quality Gates..."
npm run lint
npm test
npm run coverage
npm audit
EOF

chmod +x scripts/quality-check.sh
```

**4. Use orchestrator to coordinate these:**
```bash
@orchestrator
"Run the quality-check.sh script and report the results"
```

## Directory Structure That Actually Works

For the orchestrator to work with your project:

```
your-project/
├── .factory/           # Optional: project-specific droids
│   └── droids/
│       └── custom-droid.md
├── src/
├── tests/
├── package.json
└── ...

~/.factory/            # Global factory configuration
├── droids/
│   ├── orchestrator.md        ✅ Already exists
│   ├── frontend-developer.md  ✅ Already exists
│   └── ...
├── orchestrator/      # Orchestrator system files (documentation)
│   ├── task-patterns.json
│   ├── orchestrator-config.json
│   └── ...
└── docs/             # Documentation (what we created)
    └── ...
```

**The orchestrator droid can work from anywhere** - it doesn't need to be in your project root.

## Testing Your Orchestrator

### Test 1: Simple Delegation
```bash
factory
@orchestrator
"What droids do you have available?"
```

Expected: Orchestrator lists all available droids

### Test 2: Task Analysis
```bash
@orchestrator
"I need to add a contact form to my website. What's your plan?"
```

Expected: Orchestrator creates a plan showing which droids it will use

### Test 3: Actual Execution
```bash
@orchestrator
"Create a simple React component called ContactForm.tsx in src/components/"
```

Expected: Orchestrator delegates to frontend-developer and creates the file

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: "Nothing happens when I call @orchestrator"
**Solution**: Make sure you're in Factory CLI first:
```bash
# Wrong
@orchestrator "task"

# Right
factory              # Start factory first
@orchestrator        # Then select droid
"task description"   # Then give task
```

### Issue 2: "Orchestrator doesn't delegate tasks"
**Solution**: Check that other droids exist:
```bash
ls ~/.factory/droids/
# Should show: frontend-developer.md, backend-architect.md, etc.
```

### Issue 3: "Commands like run-verification don't work"
**Solution**: Those were conceptual. Use natural language:
```bash
# Instead of: @orchestrator run-verification
# Use: @orchestrator "Run all tests and quality checks on the project"
```

## Summary

### ✅ What Works Now
- Natural language task delegation via `@orchestrator`
- Automatic droid selection and coordination
- Multi-phase task execution
- Result synthesis

### ❌ What Doesn't Exist Yet (was conceptual)
- CLI commands like `run-verification`
- Automated quality gates
- Performance monitoring dashboard
- Plugin system
- Cloud integration commands

### 🛠️ To Make It Real
You'd need to implement actual code (TypeScript/Node.js) for:
- Quality gate runners
- Test frameworks
- Performance monitoring
- CLI command parser

**But the core orchestrator droid already works** - just use natural language! 🎯

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/your/project

# 2. Start Factory
factory

# 3. Use orchestrator
@orchestrator

# 4. Give it a task
"Add a user authentication feature with login and registration forms"

# 5. Watch it delegate to specialized droids and coordinate the work!
```

That's it! No complex commands needed - just natural language. 🚀
