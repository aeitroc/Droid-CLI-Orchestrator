# Orchestrator Usage Examples

This document demonstrates how the orchestrator coordinates specialized droids to accomplish complex tasks.

## Example 1: Simple Task - Bug Fix

**User Request**: "The login button is not working properly"

### Without Orchestrator
User manually selects `debugger` droid, runs diagnosis, then switches to appropriate specialist.

### With Orchestrator
```
üéØ Orchestrator Analysis:
- Complexity: Simple ‚Üí Medium (need diagnosis first)
- Strategy: Sequential
- Droids Needed: debugger ‚Üí specialist ‚Üí test-automator

üìã Execution:
Phase 1: Diagnosis
  ‚Üí debugger: "Investigate login button issue. Check for errors in console, network requests, event handlers, and any recent changes that might have affected the login functionality."
  
Phase 2: Fix (based on diagnosis)
  ‚Üí frontend-developer: "Fix the login button issue identified in Phase 1: [specific issue]. The problem is in [file/component]."
  
Phase 3: Verification
  ‚Üí test-automator: "Create test cases for login button functionality to prevent regression."
```

**Result**: Bug fixed with proper diagnosis, implementation, and tests added to prevent recurrence.

## Tips for Using the Orchestrator

### 1. Be Specific in Your Request
‚ùå Bad: "Build a feature"
‚úÖ Good: "Build a user notification system with email and in-app notifications"

### 2. Trust the Orchestrator's Plan
The orchestrator will present a plan before execution. Review it and approve, or ask for adjustments.

### 3. Let It Handle Coordination
Don't micromanage droid selection. The orchestrator knows which droids work best together.

### 4. Provide Feedback Between Phases
If a phase completes but doesn't meet your needs, tell the orchestrator before continuing.

### 5. Use for Complex Tasks
For simple single-domain tasks, directly use the specialist droid. The orchestrator shines with complexity.

## When to Use Each Approach

### Use Orchestrator For:
- ‚úÖ Features spanning multiple domains (frontend + backend + database)
- ‚úÖ Tasks requiring security review
- ‚úÖ Complex implementations needing coordination
- ‚úÖ When you're unsure which droids to use
- ‚úÖ Production-critical features requiring review

### Use Direct Droid For:
- ‚úÖ Simple bug fixes in known area
- ‚úÖ Quick styling adjustments
- ‚úÖ Single-file modifications
- ‚úÖ When you know exactly which specialist you need
- ‚úÖ Time-critical simple fixes

## Orchestrator Command Examples

### Invoke Orchestrator
```bash
# In Factory CLI
> @orchestrator

# Then provide your task
"Build a real-time chat feature with WebSockets"
```

### Orchestrator with Constraints
```bash
"Build user authentication but we must use PostgreSQL for the database and NextAuth.js for the frontend"
```

### Orchestrator with Preferences
```bash
"Implement a blog system. I prefer MongoDB over PostgreSQL, and I want to use markdown for post content"
```
