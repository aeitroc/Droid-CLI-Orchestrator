# Orchestrator Task Tool Fix

## Issue
The orchestrator was trying to use the Task tool to delegate to specialist droids, but the Task tool was not in its available tools list, causing delegation attempts to fail:

```
TASK (backend-architect: "Design database schema and API architecture")
⚠ Task failed
```

## Root Cause
The orchestrator's frontmatter had:
```yaml
tools: ["Read", "LS", "Grep", "Glob", "Create", "Edit", "MultiEdit", "Execute", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "FetchUrl"]
```

The `Task` tool was missing!

## Fix Applied
Added `Task` to the orchestrator's tools array:

```yaml
tools: ["Read", "LS", "Grep", "Glob", "Create", "Edit", "MultiEdit", "Execute", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "FetchUrl", "Task"]
```

## Updates Made

### 1. Added Task Tool
- File: `/Users/besi/.factory/droids/orchestrator.md`
- Change: Added `"Task"` to tools array in frontmatter

### 2. Updated Documentation
- Added Task tool usage examples
- Clarified when to use Task vs direct implementation
- Updated capabilities section to include delegation

### 3. Usage Guidelines

**Use Task Tool When:**
- Highly specialized domains (security audits, performance optimization)
- Complex UI/UX design requirements
- Advanced DevOps infrastructure
- Parallel execution of independent tasks needed
- User explicitly requests specific expertise

**Work Directly When:**
- Project analysis and research
- Creating project structure
- Implementing based on patterns
- File creation and editing
- Simple to medium complexity features

## Example Usage

```markdown
# Orchestrator can now delegate:
TASK (backend-architect: "Design database schema for marketplace")
TASK (ui-ux-designer: "Create wireframes and design system")
TASK (security-auditor: "Review authentication and payment flows")

# Or work directly:
CREATE (package.json)
EXECUTE (npm install)
EDIT (tsconfig.json)
```

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Delegation Works** - Can now spawn specialist droids
2. ✅ **Parallel Execution** - Multiple specialists can work simultaneously
3. ✅ **Flexibility** - Can choose between direct work and delegation
4. ✅ **Specialized Expertise** - Access to focused specialist knowledge
5. ✅ **Hybrid Approach** - Best of both worlds

## Testing

The orchestrator can now:
- ✅ Delegate to @backend-architect for database design
- ✅ Delegate to @ui-ux-designer for UI/UX work
- ✅ Delegate to @security-auditor for security reviews
- ✅ Work directly for setup and configuration
- ✅ Choose optimal approach based on task complexity

## Version
- **Before**: v2.0.0 (Self-sufficient only)
- **After**: v2.1.0 (Self-sufficient + Delegation)
- **Date**: 2025-06-18
- **Status**: Active and Ready

---

**Note**: The orchestrator now has the best of both worlds - can work directly for efficiency OR delegate to specialists for expertise!
