# Orchestrator Updates - Self-Sufficient Mode

## Summary of Changes

The orchestrator has been updated to be **self-sufficient** rather than delegating to other droids via the Task tool.

## Key Changes

### 1. No Task Tool Usage
- **Before**: Orchestrator tried to use Task tool to delegate to specialist droids
- **After**: Orchestrator works directly using its available tools
- **Reason**: Task tool is not available in orchestrator's tool set

### 2. Direct Implementation
The orchestrator can now:
- Perform research using WebSearch and FetchUrl
- Analyze codebases using Read, Grep, Glob
- Implement features using Create, Edit, MultiEdit
- Execute commands using Execute
- Manage complex tasks using TodoWrite

### 3. Memory Integration
The orchestrator now loads learning from:
- `/Users/besi/.factory/orchestrator/memory/success_patterns.json`
- `/Users/besi/.factory/orchestrator/memory/failure_patterns.json`
- `/Users/besi/.factory/orchestrator/memory/project_templates.json`
- `/Users/besi/.factory/orchestrator/memory/learning_metrics.json`

### 4. Updated Workflow

**New Workflow:**
1. Analyze requirements
2. Read memory files for patterns and templates
3. Create execution plan with TodoWrite
4. Execute implementation directly
5. Suggest specialist droids only when truly needed
6. Synthesize results

**When to Suggest Specialists:**
- Highly specialized domains (security audits, performance optimization)
- Complex UI/UX design requirements
- Advanced DevOps infrastructure
- When user explicitly requests specific expertise

**When to Work Directly:**
- Project analysis and research
- Creating project structure
- Implementing based on existing patterns
- File creation and editing
- Simple to medium complexity features

## How It Works Now

### Example: Starting a New Project

```markdown
User: "Create a Next.js app with authentication"

Orchestrator:
1. Reads memory files to find React/Next.js success patterns
2. Checks for Next.js templates
3. Creates TodoWrite plan with all phases
4. Executes directly:
   - Creates project structure
   - Sets up configuration files
   - Implements authentication based on patterns
   - Tests the implementation
5. Provides summary to user
```

### Example: Complex Multi-Domain Project

```markdown
User: "Build e-commerce platform with payments and mobile app"

Orchestrator:
1. Reads memory files
2. Creates comprehensive plan
3. Implements what it can directly (project setup, basic structure)
4. Suggests to user: "For optimal results, consider using:
   - @frontend-developer for React storefront
   - @mobile-developer for native mobile app
   - @payment-integration for Stripe setup
   - @security-auditor for PCI compliance
   Would you like me to continue implementing directly or would you prefer to use specialists?"
```

## Benefits

1. **Faster execution** - No delegation overhead for simple tasks
2. **Better context** - Orchestrator maintains full context throughout
3. **More flexible** - Can handle wide range of complexity
4. **Learning enabled** - Uses memory files to improve over time
5. **User choice** - User can request specialists when needed

## Migration Notes

- Old orchestrator behavior: Tried to use Task tool → Failed
- New orchestrator behavior: Works directly → Succeeds
- Specialist droids still available when user requests them
- No breaking changes to memory files or other droids

## Files Modified

1. `/Users/besi/.factory/droids/orchestrator.md`
   - Updated description to reflect self-sufficient mode
   - Changed core responsibilities
   - Updated working model
   - Added direct implementation capabilities
   - Clarified when to suggest specialists

## Testing

To test the new orchestrator:
```bash
# The orchestrator should now:
# 1. Read memory files at start
# 2. Create plans with TodoWrite
# 3. Execute implementations directly
# 4. Not try to use Task tool
```
