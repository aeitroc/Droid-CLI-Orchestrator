# Orchestrator Automation Concepts (Planned)

This document records prior exploration into automating the orchestrator through dedicated tooling. The scripted workflow is **currently not implemented**. Use it as design notes rather than executable guidance.

---

## Goals for Future Automation

- Coordinate phases without manual hand-offs.
- Support parallel delegation when dependencies permit.
- Emit structured artifacts (plans, reports, phase transcripts).
- Enforce quality gates automatically (security, testing, performance).

## Architectural Sketch

1. **Phase Planner** – analyzes a request, selects matching entries from `task-patterns.json`, and adapts them to context.
2. **Execution Scheduler** – orders phases, resolves parallelizable segments, and monitors completion signals.
3. **Context Broker** – persists intermediate outputs under `orchestrator/context-manager.md` guidelines.
4. **Quality Gate Handler** – checks each phase against `orchestrator-config.json` requirements before allowing progression.
5. **Synthesis Engine** – aggregates results and highlights outstanding risks.

## Manual Alternative

Until automation exists:
- Use the planner outline above to guide how you interact with droids manually.
- Record hand-offs between phases in your task notes to emulate the scheduler.
- Apply the quality gate checklist from `automated-quality-gates.md` after each phase.
- Summarize findings in a final report stored with the task artifacts.

## Next Steps for Implementation

When resources are available, the automation should:
1. Provide a CLI entrypoint that reads orchestration requests.
2. Implement reliable persistence for context and artifacts.
3. Offer clear logging around each delegation and gate decision.
4. Ship with regression tests covering sequential, parallel, and hybrid flows.

Until then, treat this document as a blueprint rather than an instruction manual.
